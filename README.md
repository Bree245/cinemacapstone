# 🎬 Cinema Management System - Capstone Project

## 📌 Overview
This is my final Capstone Project for the University of Hull.  
It is a **Cinema Management System** written in **C#** that demonstrates multiple OOP principles and project structuring.  
The program simulates managing a cinema, including:
- Selling tickets & concessions
- Adding new screenings
- Managing memberships (including Gold members)
- Saving & loading data

## 🛠 Features
- **Sell Tickets & Concessions**: Different ticket types and concession sales.
- **Screening Management**: Add and manage movie screenings.
- **Membership System**: Create, view, and upgrade members to Gold.
- **Data Persistence**: Save and load member/screening data using files.
- **OOP Principles**: Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Abstraction.
